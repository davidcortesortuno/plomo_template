# plomo_template
A modern University of Southampton PhD thesis template

## Description

This collection of LaTeX files is a modern template for a PhD thesis. The format of this template follows 
the rules of the University of Southampton for the publication of a thesis (margins, front pages, etc.).
Still, I recommend to check the rules in the official University of Southampton library online documents.

The template is based on `Komascript` with the `Lato` font, which is in the official CTAN LaTeX packages
repository. Math fonts are customised to use `Lato` font numbers and `cmbright` math symbols.

A `Makefile` is provided so you can compile the files using `make` or `make nomen` in case of specifying
a nomenclature.

All the necessary chapters for a thesis are in the `chapters` directory.

An example PDF of how the thesis would look like is in the `example` directory
